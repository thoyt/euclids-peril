Not particularly "done"
=======================

* Embetterment
  - Make it not so easy somehow?
  - Make the weapons worth using/make sense (triangle strike sides instead of rear flanks?)
  - Make enemies try second direction if one direction is blocked and other would make progress

* Sound 
  - Music for the intro
  - Music for the game
  - Really we should refine the sound effects too


Nice to have
============

* Tutorial screen
* Game over screen
  - Music for the game over screen 


Done-ish
========

* Enemies
  - spheres die in two hits while frozen
  - tiles protect you from certain enemies
  - three types
* Items
  - point
    - attack single square
  - line
    - attack in a straight line
  - triangle
    - attack in triangle pattern around direction
  - square
    - 4 "pts"
* Powerups
  - heart/life
  - "energy"?? (how about no)
  - items themselves (auto-pick)
